# SmartBrain Homebrew cask — for the tap repo SecureCloudGroup/homebrew-tap.
# Installs with:  brew install --cask securecloudgroup/tap/smartbrain
#
# The app has no paid Apple Developer ID (a deliberate $0 choice) — it is ad-hoc signed, which is all
# Apple Silicon needs to RUN it. The only thing that would stop it is the quarantine flag, and modern
# Homebrew applies that to every cask with no built-in override. So the postflight below strips it,
# which is safe here because we built and ad-hoc-signed this exact bundle in our own CI. Without this
# step the user would hit the Gatekeeper "unidentified developer" wall — the whole reason we ship via
# Homebrew instead of a browser download is to avoid exactly that.

  caveats <<~EOS
    SmartBrain runs on Docker. If you don't have it yet, install Docker first (Docker Desktop is the
    easiest; Colima/OrbStack also work) and start it: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
    Note: Docker Desktop's own first launch asks you to accept its terms — do that before continuing.

    SmartBrain has been LAUNCHED for you — it's a menu-bar app (icon at the top-right of your
    screen). The first run downloads the app image (a minute or two), then opens it in your browser
    at http://localhost:33000. To start it again later, open SmartBrain from Applications.

    If macOS asks whether SmartBrain may "access data from other apps", click Allow — that's it
    locating your Docker installation.

    Your data lives in Docker volumes and survives uninstalls; back it up in-app (Settings).

  # "zap" removes the launcher's config dir. The user's DATA is in Docker volumes (smartbrain_data /
  # bifrost_data), which Homebrew cannot remove — deliberate: uninstalling an app should not silently
  # shred a knowledge base. Removing the data is an explicit `docker volume rm` by the user.
